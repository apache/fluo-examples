Webindex is an example [Apache Fluo][fluo] application that incrementally indexes links to web pages
in multiple ways. If you are new to Fluo, you may want start with the [Fluo tour][tour] as the
WebIndex application is more complicated. For more information on how the WebIndex application
works, view the [tables](docs/tables.md) and [code](docs/code-guide.md) documentation.

Webindex utilizes multiple projects.  [Common Crawl][cc] web crawl data is used as the input.
[Apache Spark][spark] is used to initialize Fluo and incrementally load data into Fluo.  [Apache
Accumulo][accumulo] is used to hold the indexes and Fluo's data.  Fluo is used to continuously
combine new and historical information about web pages and update an external index when changes
occur. Webindex has simple UI built using [Spark Java][sparkjava] that allows querying the indexes.

Below is a video showing repeatedly querying stackoverflow.com while Webindex was running for three
days on EC2.  The video was made by querying the Webindex instance periodically and taking a
screenshot.  More details about this video are available in this [blog post][bp].

## Running WebIndex

If you are new to WebIndex, the simplest way to run the application is to run the development
server. First, clone the WebIndex repo:

    git clone https://github.com/astralway/webindex.git

Next, on a machine where Java and Maven are installed, run the development server using the 
`webindex` command:

    cd webindex/
    ./bin/webindex dev

This will build and start the development server which will log to the console. This 'dev' command
has several command line options which can be viewed by running with `-h`. When you want to
terminate the server, press `CTRL-c`.

The development server starts a MiniAccumuloCluster and runs MiniFluo on top of it. It parses a
CommonCrawl data file and creates a file at `data/1000-pages.txt` with 1000 pages that are loaded
into MiniFluo. The number of pages loaded can be changed to 5000 by using the command below:

    ./bin/webindex dev --pages 5000

The pages are processed by Fluo which exports indexes to Accumulo. The development server also
starts a web application  at [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) that queries indexes in
Accumulo.

If you would like to run WebIndex on a cluster, follow the [install] instructions. 

### Viewing metrics

Metrics can be sent from the development server to InfluxDB and viewed in Grafana. You can either
setup InfluxDB+Grafana on you own or use [Uno] command `uno setup metrics`. After a metrics server
is started, start the development server the option `--metrics` to start sending metrics:

    ./bin/webindex dev --metrics

Fluo metrics can be viewed in Grafana.  To view application-specific metrics for Webindex, import
the WebIndex Grafana dashboard located at `contrib/webindex-dashboard.json`.
